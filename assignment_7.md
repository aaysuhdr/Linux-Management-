# Assisgnment 6:Part 1: Understanding APT & System Updates (15 min) 
### Here is the code which i had perfermed to complete this task 

```
apt --version
```
```
sudo apt update
```
```
 sudo apt upgrade -y
 ```
 ```
 apt list --upgradable
 ```
 ```
  apt search image editor
```
```
 read zim
```
```
apt show "zim"
```
```
sudo apt install "zim" -y
```
```
 apt list --installed | grep "zim"
```
```
 sudo apt remove "zim" -y
```
```
 sudo apt purge "$zim" -y
```
```
sudo apt clean
```
```
 sudo add-apt-repository universe
```
```
 sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install fakepackage
```
```
read hold_package
```
```
 sudo apt-mark hold "zim"
```
```
sudo apt-mark unhold "zim"
```
------------
### So here are the pictures for the Assisgnment

# Assignment 7: Linux Virtualization 
**Date:** 2025-02-19
**Author:** Aayush shrestha  (amk1006019@student.hamk.fi) 

## Part 1: Virtualization Concepts

Virtualization

The process of creating a virtual version of something, such as hardware, storage, or network resources.

Hypervisor

Software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs). Examples include KVM, VMware, and Hyper-V.

Virtual Machines (VMs)

Emulations of physical computers that run their own operating systems.

Containers

Lightweight, isolated environments that share the host OS kernel but have their own file systems and libraries.

### **VMs vs Containers**

- The difference between VMs and Containers in terms of Architecture, Resource Utilization and Isolation

| **Aspect**    | **VMs**                                          | **Containers**    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Architecture**     | Requires a full OS for each instance            | Shares the host OS kernel      |
| **Resource Utilization** | Requires more resources                        | More lightweight and efficient   |
| **Isolation**        | Provides strong isolation since each VM has its own OS | Provides a lower level of isolation, as it shares the host OS kernel |

# Assingment 8 - Firewall

## Step 1: Install and Enable iptables
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install iptables -y
```
```
sudo apt install iptables-persistent -y
```
** why**

This ensures a clean start so that old rules donâ€™t interfere with the new configuration.
## Step 2: Create Firewall Rules

Create a script file for setting up the firewall:
```
sudo nano /etc/firewall.sh 
```
### why 
 a script instead of running commands manually?
Automation & Consistency

Running firewall rules manually means they are lost after a reboot.
A script ensures the rules are applied automatically and consistently every time the system starts.


*** then we need to paste the block of code ***

## Step 3: Make the Script Executable
```
sudo chmod +x /etc/firewall.sh
```
## sudo chmod +x /etc/firewall.sh
```
sudo /etc/firewall.sh
```
## Step 5: Save Firewall Rules on Startup
```
sudo netfilter-persistent save
sudo netfilter-persistent reload
```
*** Aditionally we can use an alternative way to perform this task ***
```
echo "/etc/firewall.sh" | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.local
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```
### Step 6: Verify the Firewall
```
sudo iptables -L -v -n
```
*** to cheak backlog ***
```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```
### why:
Why is this command used?
To check if the firewall rules are correctly applied.
-to yte counts (helps in monitoring which rules are actively being used).
